  Ragazzi Difficili Bertolini.pdf     
Ragazzi Difficili Bertolini.pdf is the name of a book written by Piero Bertolini, Letizia Caronia, Piero Barone, and Cristina Palmieri. The book is about the phenomenon of juvenile delinquency and the educational approach to deal with it. The book was first published in 2015 by FrancoAngeli, and it is based on the experience of Piero Bertolini as the director of the Cesare Beccaria Juvenile Detention Center in Milan.
     
The book proposes a pedagogical interpretation of juvenile delinquency, based on the phenomenological perspective. The authors argue that the so-called "difficult children" are not simply deviant or maladjusted, but rather they have a different way of perceiving and relating to reality. They need an educational intervention that can help them expand their field of experience, develop their self-awareness, and construct a new worldview. The book also emphasizes the role and the formation of the professional educator, who has to be able to understand and communicate with the children, without imposing preconceived models or solutions.
